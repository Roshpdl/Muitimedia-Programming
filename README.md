# Processing 4
Few interesting projects to try out creative coding using Processing and PureData

Skills Obtained:

Image Processing Algorithms (Pixellation, Pointillism, Grayscale, Mirroring, Applying Filters, Rasterization, etc)

Audio Processing (FFT analysis, Peak Amplitude Analysis, etc.)

P3D (Building 3D objects and shapes, syncing them with audio amplitude, and so on)

Generative Art

PureData Patches (Using pure data to generate audio patches, oscillators, envelope(ADSR), MIDI, OSC, etc)

Object Oriented Programming
